## Step-by-Step Instructions  

### Step 1: Prepare the Spaghetti  
- If using leftover spaghetti, reheat it in the microwave or on the stove until warm.  
- Ensure the spaghetti is well-coated with sauce to prevent dryness.  

### Step 2: Assemble the Sandwich  
1. Take two slices of bread.  
2. Place a layer of spaghetti on one slice. Spread it evenly, but don’t overstuff to avoid spillage.  
3. (Optional) Add a layer of cheese over the spaghetti for extra flavor and binding.  
4. Sprinkle any seasonings, such as garlic powder or chili flakes, if desired.  
5. Place the second slice of bread on top to close the sandwich.  

### Step 3: Toast the Sandwich  
1. Heat a skillet or pan over medium heat.  
2. Spread butter or brush olive oil on the outer sides of the bread.  
3. Place the sandwich in the skillet.  
4. Toast for 2–3 minutes on each side, pressing gently with a spatula, until the bread is golden brown and crispy.  

### Step 4: Slice and Serve  
- Remove the sandwich from the skillet and let it cool for a minute.  
- Slice it in half for easier handling and serve immediately.
