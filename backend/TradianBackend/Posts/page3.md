The MNSW system is an online and digital system designed to simplify trade by providing a single, unified platform for submitting and exchanging trade documents and data. This system represents a significant leap towards modernising international trade processes and procedures in the Maldives.

The rollout event for the system is scheduled for 3rd September, 2024. With the rollout of the system imminent, a flurry of preparatory activities is underway to spread awareness on the system and ensure that the rollout goes smoothly.

Let’s take a look at some of the key activities that the MNSW team has undertaken since July in preparation for the upcoming rollout.


## MNSW User Acceptance Testing Sessions
One of the key activities we’d like to highlight is the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) sessions. These sessions, which were held in the Training Room at our head office, commenced on July 21 and continued until August 15.

The UAT is the final stage of testing for the MNSW system. It involved having real users test the software to confirm it meets their needs and requirements, as well as assessing the system's readiness for deployment. 


## The Participants
The sessions were open to representatives from the cross-border regulatory authorities (CBRAs) operating in the Maldives, as well as to select members of the local trade community. A total of 78 participants took part in the UAT sessions, which were conducted by the CRIMSONLOGIC team.

CRIMSONLOGIC is the turn-key vendor working with Tradenet to build the MNSW system in accordance with the unique needs of local CBRAs and trade stakeholders.

Some of the CBRAs in attendance included Maldives Customs Service, Maldives Ports Limited, Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Construction and Infrastructure, Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Construction and Infrastructure, and the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation.

Local trade stakeholders included representatives from freight forwarders, shipping agents, importers, exporters, and Customs brokers.


## The Approach
The testing occurred over three weeks and included both morning and afternoon sessions, each targeting different groups of users. 

During the UAT, participants were guided through specific test scenarios to confirm that the software operates correctly. Bugs, observations, and behaviours were documented and reported.

The testing also focused on identifying post-deployment issues, gathering user feedback, and managing expectations in the live environment.


## The Outcome
The MNSW team reported that the UAT was a significant success. The participants were highly engaged and eager to familiarise themselves with the system and work through the test scenarios. 

The feedback received was both positive and instrumental in further optimising the system.


## MNSW Training & Awareness Sessions
Another key activity to highlight is the MNSW Training and Awareness Sessions, which are being conducted both internally and externally.

These sessions are being organised by the Learning & Development team and the MNSW team. The sessions are being conducted by representatives from the CRIMSONLOGIC team.

The aim of these training and awareness sessions is to promote the MNSW system to a broader audience and increase understanding among key government and trader stakeholders about its functionality and benefits.

The sessions began on August 25 and will continue until September 5. These sessions were also conducted in the Training Room at our head office.


## The Participants
The training and awareness sessions for external parties were held for female entrepreneurs, freight forwarders, shipping agents, as well as representatives from the Maldives Customs Service and the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation.

The sessions for internal parties aimed to inform Tradenet staff about the system, including its functionality and benefits.


## The Approach
These sessions also focused on gathering feedback and addressing any remaining questions about the system. They covered some of the limitations of phase 1 and set expectations for transitioning to a digital environment.

The training and awareness sessions were conducted as interactive hybrid events, allowing participants to join either in person or digitally.


## The Outcome
The MNSW team and Learning & Development team reported that the sessions have been well-received by both external and internal participants. 

Each session was lively, featuring engaging questions and insightful discussions.


As the MNSW system rollout approaches, the team has concluded the UAT sessions and is hard at work raising awareness among relevant stakeholders. The response from participants has been excellent so far and we are very grateful for their active participation.

The MNSW system will serve as a centralised messaging hub for all trade-related transactions, connecting various stakeholders such as government agencies, importers, exporters, customs brokers, shipping agents, and freight forwarders. 

By integrating diverse trade-related processes and actors, the MNSW is poised to eliminate inefficiencies present in the current system, making trade operations smoother, efficient and more predictable.

The digital transformation of trade is almost here!
